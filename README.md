# synthesisTKL
The synthesisTKL is a bespoke tenkeyless mechanical keyboard being developed by domvt.
The project was *initially* intended to be a 1 of 1 build, but during the development process I decided I would like to shift the scope of the project. It is now under the *GNU General Public v3.0* licence so other users may recreate it and iterate upon it (excluding commerical use). The project is still in development, but should it be succesful, I hope to publish the docs and BOM with a guide so other users can build their own.
