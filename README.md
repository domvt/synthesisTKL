# synthesisTKL
The synthesisTKL is a bespoke tenkeyless mechanical keyboard being developed by domvt. The synthesisTKL aims to be a friendly and performant system that can accomodate a wide variety of cases, layouts, and connections. Whether it be a billet titanium case or a plastic one from a low-cost 3D printer, the components are designed to be the backbone of any design you can think of. Most importantly, every single file, CAD model, and step of its development will be documented.

The project was *initially* intended to be a 1-of-1 build, but during the development process, I decided I would like to shift the scope of the project. It is now under the *GNU General Public v3.0* license so other users may recreate it and iterate upon it (excluding commercial use). The project is still in development, but should it be successful, I will publish the docs and an extensive guide so others can build their own.
